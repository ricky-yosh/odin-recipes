# odin-recipes

Website intended to create recipe's for the odin project's "Project: Recipes" assignment. This is from not knowing any html to knowing some and is a test of my knowledge.

What I have learned:
- How to create a boilerplate for html
- paragraphs
- headers
- lists
- images
- basic html formatting
